# Graphics Coursework

## Basic Controls:

| Control | Description |
| :---: | :--- |
W    | Forward
S   | Backward
A    | Left
D    | Right
C | Toggle Camera Animation
SHIFT | Move Camera Up
SPACE | Move Camera Down

## Features Implemented:
- SplatMap 
- Bump Texture
- Imported Mesh
- Scene Graph Management
- Directional Light
- Camera Rotation around scene
- Water Texture
- CubeMaps

## Project Highlights:
The project enabled me to accumulate a substantial amount of knowledge, which was both impressive and provided a comprehensive introduction to various facets of the graphics pipeline. For example generating textures using splat maps, implementation of lights and engaging with a graphics API about which I had no prior familiarity. The key insight I've gained from this project is that although I acknowledge the potential for further implementation, my awareness of the improvements I would introduce reflects my personal growth.

## Problems faced during project:
Problems which I faced during this project would be creating a proper rendering pipeline for different meshes, porting meshes from Unity to msh files. Learning to make a proper pipeline functioning took lots of time which could've been used to polish other aspects like having lights implemented on the imported assets.
